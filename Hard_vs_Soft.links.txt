Hardlinks : same inode number as the oroginal file.
if you remove the source file, nothing will happen to hardlinks.
think of hardlinks like the copy paste.
but with one advantage, that is the changes made toeither files will be reflected on both of them.


Softlinks: shortcut. delete sourcefile, softlink os of no use.
